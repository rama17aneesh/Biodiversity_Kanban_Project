# Biodiversity_Kanban_Project

For this project I will Interpret data about endangered species from different parks in United States for the National Parks Service.
 
I will perform Data analysis on the conservation statuses of the species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.

In this project, I use Jupyter notebook to analyze, clean, and plot the data as well as answer the questions and communicate findings in a meaningful way through Data Visualization.

# This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.

Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?


## Evaluation
As the project advancement, more insights can be generated, allowing us to answer a broader range of questions.

- I have learned from the analysis that if we want to compare two dataset that went through changes we have to look after different naming conventions, formatting and how they are listed in the dataset.

# coming to questions that are not answered from the analysis,
1. When did the observations captured, did conservationist collect when it was bird migration season, and require dataset about different bird species migration patterns.
2. In the species dataset, they are birds and mammals species wit common name "American", when counting the species we need to carefully manipulate the data accordingly.

# for evaluating the project, here is a question that can be answered from analyzing the data in different methodology
- Observational frequency:- Instead of counting unique species name, we can count the total number of observations to determine the most frequently observed species in each park.
